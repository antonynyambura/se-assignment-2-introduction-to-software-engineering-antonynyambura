# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves some computational purpose. Software is considered to be a collection of executable programming code, associated librariess and documentations. software, when made for specific requirement is called "software product".
Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products,using well-defined, scientific princeples and methods.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with the development of software products using well defined scientific principles, it involves the desing,development,testing,deployment and maintainance of software products.

Software Development Life Cycle 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirement:
-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
2. Design:
-Creating a high standard and detailed design of the user software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation:
-Building software and writing codes inline with high standard of the design specification.
4. Testing and Validation:
-Conducting all test to make sure the software is functionig well and that it meet quality standards.
5. Deployment:
-Here a complete or partially complete version of software is presented to the user or customer to evaluate, and they give feedback based on evaluation.
6.Maintainance:
-Provide followup support,update and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
AGILE
-Iterlative and icremental.
-Flexbility.
-Collaboration.
WATERFALL
-Sequential process.
-Rigid sturucture.
-Emphasis on learnig.
Key difference
Agile is prefered for projects with evolving requirement,high uncertainity and need for rapid adaptaion.
Waterfall on the other hand is prefered for projects with well defined requirements low uncertinity and stable enviroment.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is a systematic process of gathering, documenting, analyzing, and managing requirements for a software system.
Process include:
-Elicitation.
-Analysis.
-Testing and Validation.
-Tracebility and Managment.
IMPORTANCE
- Alignment with Stakeholder Needs.
- Imoroved communication.
- Reduce risk and coct.
- Foundation for design and development.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable and independent components or modules. 
    it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems by (enhanced collaboration, code reuserbility, and easire testing).

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit test-is validating individual components or modules of software.
Itergration testing- is testing interaction between different component or systems.
System testing- this is the test of the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- this is testing the software to make sure it meets the user expectation.
    testing is crucial for it helps identify defect on time in the development process, leading to quality software products.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems - are software tools that help manage changes to source code over time.
they are important for (collaboration, backup and disaster recovery).
GIT is one example of version control system, features include (branching and merging with ease).

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of a software project manager is crucial in ensuring the successful delivery of software projects within budget, on schedule, and according to specifications. Project managers act as the bridge between stakeholders, clients, and the development team, overseeing all aspects of the project lifecycle.
Key responsibility include
-Quality assuarance.
-Communication.
-Budget and resourse managment.
-Risk managment.
-Planning.
Challenge include:
-Conflict resolution.
-Risk managment.
-Communication breakdown.
-Schedule pressure.
-Resourse constrains.
-Adapting to change.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
It involves making changes to the software to correct faults, improve performance, adapt it to a changing environment, or enhance its functionality.
 Types of maintainance:
-Corrective Maintenance: ensures that the software operates as intended and addresses any issues that may arise during its use.
-Adaptive Maintenance: It ensures that the software remains functional in evolving conditions.
 -Perfective maintenance involves making enhancements to the software to improve its performance, usability, or functionality.
-Preventive Maintenance: This include activities such as code refactoring, performance tuning, or security updates to mitigate future risks and improve the overall quality of the software.
Essencial:
 Software maintenance is essential for ensuring the long-term success and viability of software systems, enabling them to remain functional, reliable, and valuable to users and stakeholders.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some ethical issues include:
-Biasness.
-Tranceparency.
-And Intellectual property violation.
To ensure ehtical adherance standards in their work software engineers can,
-Follow best practises.
-Continuously learn and improve.
-And Seekfeedback.
